# Sentinel — Microservice Health Monitor

**Sentinel** is a powerful **MERN stack** microservice health monitoring platform designed to help engineering teams **ensure reliability, uptime, performance, and rapid alerting** across distributed systems.

It is currently **under active development**, but already includes core capabilities such as service health checks, alert integrations, SLA insights, and Prometheus-compatible metrics.

---

## Demo & Links

* **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/madugushivakumar/Sentinel-MicroserviceHealthMonitor](https://github.com/madugushivakumar/Sentinel-MicroserviceHealthMonitor)
* *(Planned)* **Live Demo / Deployment:** *Coming Soon*
* *(Optional Demo Video)*: *Coming Soon*

> This project is in development and evolving rapidly.

## What Sentinel Solves

Modern microservice architectures require robust monitoring to:

* Detect service outages & performance degradation
* Calculate uptime, latency, error rates, and reliability scores
* Alert teams instantly through multiple channels
* Provide historical insights and visualizations

Sentinel helps engineering teams visualize and automate this process, reducing downtime and debugging effort across services.

---

## Key Features *(Already Implemented)*

**Real-time Health Monitoring** — Scheduled health checks (e.g., every 10s)
**Incident Detection & Tracking**
**Multi-channel Alerting**

* Slack, Telegram, Email, WhatsApp support
  **WebSocket Live Updates** — UI updates in real time
  **Service Registration & Management**
  **Historical Health Data Visualization**
  **SLA/SLO Reliability Scoring**
  **Prometheus-Compatible Metrics Endpoint**
  **Service Metrics (latency, availability, CPU/memory)**

*(These features reflect the current implementation state in the repo.)* ([GitHub][1])

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* React 18
* React Router
* Socket.IO Client (live updates)
* Recharts (visual charts)
* TailwindCSS

**Backend**

* Node.js + Express
* MongoDB + Mongoose
* Socket.IO (WebSockets)
* Node-cron (scheduled checks)
* Axios (HTTP client)
* Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

*(Based on repo structure and common MERN patterns.)* ([GitHub][1])

---

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

* **Node.js** (v18+)
* **npm** or **yarn**
* **MongoDB** (local or cloud)

*(Required for local development.)* ([GitHub][1])

---

## Installation & Setup

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file based on example or your own settings:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongo_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
# Optional alert configs:
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=
EMAIL_HOST=
EMAIL_PORT=
EMAIL_USER=
EMAIL_PASS=
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=
```

Start backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

Run frontend in development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## API Endpoints

*(Examples based on current design — update as implemented.)* ([GitHub][1])

### Services

```
GET /api/services
GET /api/services/:id
POST /api/services
PUT /api/services/:id
DELETE /api/services/:id
```

### Health & Metrics

```
GET /api/health/latest
GET /api/health/:serviceId/history
GET /metrics   # Prometheus export
```

### Alerts

```
POST /api/alerts/test  # Send test alert
```

---

## Monitoring & Reliability

Sentinel calculates:

* **Service availability**
* **Latency percentiles (P50, P95, P99)**
* **Error rates**
* **SLO compliance**
* **Reliability scoring**

This helps teams catch performance regressions early.

---

## Roadmap (Planned)

Add role-based access & auth UI
Dashboard graphs & drill-downs
Kubernetes health integrations
AI assisted anomaly detection
Export reports & CSV/PDF
Marketplace integrations (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Teams)
